## Datasets
The data in [this directory](https://github.com/Phileodontist/Udacity/tree/main/Streaming/Optimizing-Public-Transporation-Project/workspace/producers/data) is used as the seed data that simulator uses to generate event data.

Much of the data in the directory is derived from the (City of Chicago Transit Authority's open
datasets](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/). The following datasets originate from this source:

* [`cta_stations.csv`](cta_stations.csv)
* [`ridership_seed.csv`](ridership_seed.csv)

The data from these sources has been truncated and some columns were added to make the simulation
more useful.
